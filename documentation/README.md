- As a user, I wan to create a passengers name and passport number so i can add them to a flight.
- As a user, I want to create a flight trip with a specific destination.
- As a user, I want to be able to assign and/or change a plane to my flight trip, input my password so I can handle the problem. 
- As a user, I would like to generate a flight attendees list that lists the passengers name and passports so that I can check attendee documents.
